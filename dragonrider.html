The story starts with the setting being a valley near the city of London in which Silver Dragons reside. Soon their friend rat comes and gives them a warning about humans who are coming towards the vlley. Firedrake, a young silver dragon, decides to go to the legendary Rim of Heaven, the place where silver dragons resided a long time before. He asks other dragons to come with him but no one agrees to come. Sorrel, a forest brownie, decides to accompanify him. They take advice of the oldest member of the valley who gives them some useful information and also warns them about The Golden One. Unfortunately before telling the whole information about The Golden One, the member sleeps. The rat also helps Firedrake by telling them to go to London and go to Gilbert Greytail, who makes maps that can help them.

Firedrake and Sorrel depart at night(as Firedrake can fly only in the presence of moonlight) for London. In London, they encounter some humans and save an orphan human Ben from them. Ben in return gives Sorrel some of his clothes so that she can go to meet Gilbert. There they get a map from Gilbert which marks all the dangers and safe zones. At night, again Firedrake sets to fly now accompanified by Ben. They go high in air and start their journey. Due to a misunderstanding by Sorrel, they go to the unsafe zone and land on a mountain valley occupied by mountain dwarfs. Firedrake rests while the dwarfs look at them in much surprise. Sorrel and Ben wake up have talk with the ddwarfs. one of them, named Gravelbeard, goes to the ruined castle on the top of the mountain and reports his master Neetlebrand, the Golden One and his servant Twigleg, the homonculus. Neetlebrand was an artificial dragon made by an alchemist to hunt down silver dragon. He could not fly but could travel by water very fast. He decides not to kill Firedrake but let him go to the Rim Of Heaven and kill all the dragons there. Neetlebrand also sends Twigleg after the group. Twigleg hides in the bag of Ben.

At night, Firedrake again departs but due to winds, lands in the desert of Egypt in which there are many archeologists doing research. Firedrake sleeps in a cave that is resided by a basilisk. Professor Greenbloom, a kind archeologist, saves Firedrake and also helps them with food. Ben asks him about the the thousand eye djinni to which Greenbloom gives him the residence. He also givies them one of the scales of Neetlebrand. Twigleg reports this to Neetlebrand, who immediately goes after Greenbloom. Firedrake and company depart for meeting the Djinni who knows the location of the Rim of Heaven while Greenbloom saves himself from Neetlebrand. During the journey, Twigleg builds an emotion for Ben.

After getting the information from the Djinn, Firedrake departs for Pakistan to meet Greenbloom's friend, Zubeida. Twigleg gives false information to Neetlebrand and sends him to a desert where water is very scarce. Meanwhile, there is a lunar eclipse and Firedrake lands on a serpent. The serpent tells them that how Neetlebrand and his troupe of ravens attacked the dragons who went in hiding permanently. The serpent drops them to Zubeida's village where Firedrake and his company meet Zubeida and Greenbloom. Ben also learns about the Dragon Rider Legacy. Zubeida als gives them moondew which can be used by Firedrake to fly when the moon is not there.

From there, they travel to the monastry where coming of dragons is considered as good hope. They also meet Lola Graytail, a relative of Rat and also an adventurer who flies her own jet. There Ben breaks one of the moonstones as per as the prophecy, and another brownie, Burr-Burr-Chan comes there who leads them to the Rim of Heaven. On entering the Rim of Heaven, Twigleg seas a lake of water which frightens him as Neetlebrand can easily travel through it. Lola and Graytail fly over the lack to keep a watch meanwhile the others make a plan to defeat Neetlebrand. Lola spots Neetlebrand and comes to the Rim. Neetlebrand sends Gravelbeard to go to the Rim. Gravelbeard gets caught. To Firedrake's surpise, all the dragons have been turned to stone due to the lack of moonlight except a she-dragon. Unable to make a foolproof plan to kill Neetlebrand, Sorrel spits her spit to one of the Neetlebrand's scales and Firedrake fires it in frustration. To their surprise the scale melts. They make a plan to trap Neetlebrand. They take Gravelbeard's plish and fill it with brownie spit. They set Gravelbeard free and Neetlebrand asks him to polish his armour. Gravelbeard polishes the armour with brownie spit and Neetlebrand enters the Rim. Firedrake and the she-dragon dragon-fire on him and Neetlebrand's armour starts to melt. Soon Neetlebrand dies and Gravelbeard helps the other dragons to be themselves. Ben and Twigleg go to live with Prof. Greenbloom while Firedrake asks his clan to come to the rim of Heaven.
